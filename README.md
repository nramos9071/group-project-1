# Weatherly App

## Description

This project was created as a group for UT's Full Stack Bootcamp. Our goal for the Weatherly App Webpage was to connect the user with a Spotify playlist based on the current weather in their region, or the location input in the text box. Weatherly utilizes two APIs: OpenWeather, and Spotify's API. 

OpenWeather provides many options for weather conditions, which we grouped into the following categories: Rainy, Snowy, Cloudy, Sunny, and a few miscellaneous options. We created a modal feature where the user can change their playlist if the one they generated is not what they are looking for. The webpage's style changes based on the playlist generated for each weather condition.
